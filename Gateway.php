			<h4>Creative Direction</h4>	
			<h2>Gateway Community Church</h2>
			<p>In the middle of 2018, I took a part time position as the Creative Director at Gateway Community Church in Franklin, Tennessee. It's a medium sized Nazarene church focused on a blend between internal spiritual growth and external community outreach. My work here started as simply volunteering where I saw areas that could be improved, but as work started to build up, I took on the position to oversee everything visual that the church put out. And those steps started here - a consistent, strong, and simple brand. We built upon the existing logo and created new systems of color and typography designed to unify all materials the church put out.</br></br>
			In the time I've been here, I've gotten to work on a massive range of projects, including over 20 logos (for classes, ministries, events, etc.), over 20 sets of graphics for sermon series (which include web and social graphics), and the development and design of <a href="http://www.gccfranklin.com" target="blank">Gateway's website,</a> created using a platform called Duda.</br></br>
			It's a little cliche but it's been a labor of love. My heart is in this church and it's allowed me to serve in a way I never dreamed possible.
