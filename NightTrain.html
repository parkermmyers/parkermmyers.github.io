			<h4>Branding</h4>	
			<h2>Night Train Pizza</h2>
			<p>Getting to work with a restaurant on branding was always a goal of mine, so I was thrilled when I was approach by Halo Restaurant Group to work on the branding for a new pizza place in Nashville called Night Train Pizza. Their ideas were pretty open ended, but I wanted to create something strong that would look just as good at the top of a menu as it would on the side of the build.</br></br>
			I decided to tackle interpreting the name in two ways - the "night" part would be represented by the color palette, and the "train" part would be more literal in the mark itself. We used the headlight of a train as the brand's signifying mark and gave it a strong and sturdy "N" to identify the name. That became the restaurant's main icon, and a full wordmark was extended from there to flesh things out.</br></br>
			Color was a fun excercise in developing a palette that would work equally well on dark backgrounds as it would light. The "night" color palette was developed as the default on black, using tonal shades of red to convey hierarchy and add depth to the design. We actually got to create a black menu that utilized the palette, which was relaly cool to see.</br></br>
