			<h4>Creative Direction</h4>	
			<h2>Pompano Beach Church</h2>
			<p>I was approached by Pompano Beach First Church of the Nazarene after they had seen my work for <a href="/Gateway.php" target="blank">Gateway Community Church</a> (formerly Brentwood Church of the Nazarene). They were looking for a complete brand overhaul centered around a more inclusive and community-focused push in the church.</br></br>
			We drew up a plan of attack centered around a new, adaptable logo and corresponding typography/colors. I wanted to create a brand that was unique to this particular church to help them stand out in the community. I created a simplified and bold version of a spire on the top of their church and wrapped it in a circle to help it sit next to type better. The circle also creates a logo that works very smoothly in social media.
			Barlow was chosen as the brand typeface, and after experimenting with several different pairings, we decided to embrace Barlow as the entirety of the brand's typeface, focusing on differentiation through size, color, weight, and other type treatments instead of relying on different fonts. As a result, the type is naturally very unified and comfortable.</br></br>
			Color was the final piece that was pulled together, sparked by a mood board that was bright and vibrant. This palette spoke to a very warm and energetic congregation that wore its heart of its sleeve. The palette still relies on a lot of neutrals and white space (as I prefer in most cases), but the red and yellow make for some bold and exciting accents.
