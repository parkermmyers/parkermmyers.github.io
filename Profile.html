			<h4>(Re)Branding</h4>	
			<h2>Profile Beauty Nook</h2>
			<p>Ali Jackson has been a long time client of mine since when her business was a hair concierge service - her business has since evolved into a space of its own, appropriately titled the <a href="http://profilebeautynook.com" target="blank">Profile Beauty Nook</a>. The name of her brand has always been sophistication and class, but with the rebranding to become the Nook, we wanted to soften those edges a little bit and add some warmth to the brand.</br></br>
			A move away from Playfair Display as the main typeface was the first step. It's a lovely typeface but projected an upscale image that wouldn't look out of place in a magazine. While Ali's work is definitely publication quality, her business was expanding to be more than just her work - into merchandise, a social space, and her usual complement of hair services.</br></br>
			We then wanted to add a visual element that was distinctive and simple, something that would add depth to the simple "p" logo she'd been using on social media. We created the corner or "nook" element that would hug the top right corner of the wordmark. The goal was to create something that didn't look like a letter itself, but still looked like a part of the typeface.</br></br>
			We nailed that nook to the "p" for social media, refined the existing grayscale palette, and boom - Ali's brand was ready for a relaunch that coincided with a physical space for her business. She's always been a pleasure to work with and her work makes me proud to have my name attached.
