					<p>For the past five years, I've worked in agency and in-house settings in Nashville and Indianapolis (born in the latter, living in the former). My approach strives to be clean and utilitarian - function and form working together instead of one leading the other. You can find examples of my work for magazines, podcasts, restaurants, media companies, and much more in my portfolio below.</p>
					<p>Outside of design, I play a lot of guitar (mostly Fenders) and spend a lot of time eating cheap fast food (mostly Taco Bell) with friends. I got married to my best friend (Emily) in 2015, we adopted a dog (Indy) in 2017, and we had a son (Wesley) in 2019.</p>
