			<p>I was approached by Pompano Beach to help reimagine their visual identity in early 2020. Their team brought a lot to the table in terms of their ideological branding and mission, but very little in the way of existing visual identity. It was a fun project in that sense - I had some more abstract ideas to draw inspiration from, but a wide open canvas in terms of the visual representation of that brand.</p> 

			<p>Church logos are always really tough to nail because there's so much inherent symbolism baked into religion. Navigating this while not falling prey to the simple cliches of the industry is always a challenge.</p>

			<p>While researching the church, I found the location on Google Maps and spent some time looking at the building. I stumbled across a spire on the top of the church that was unique to their location. I used this symbol as the basis of the identity, simplified it a bit, and the end result was something completely unique to their church, but the cross still easily identified the logo as Christian.</p>

			<p>As a result, we ended up with a logo that referenced the community and physical location of the church in a very simple, identifiable way. Now, there's some coherence between the branding of the physical building and the visual identity.</p>

			<p>The rest of the identity was designed to be very clean and flexible. There's a lot of neutral colors and an industrial sort of sans-serif that can fit in with however the church chooses to extend its brand. A couple of accent colors were selected for fun, but the core of the brand relies on a basic identity.</p>
